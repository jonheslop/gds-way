This is a manual to accompany the
[programming language recommendations](../standards/programming-languages.html).

## Code styleguides

Developers read code much more often than they write it. These guidelines
are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent
across GDS projects.

A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is
important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within
one module or function is most important.

But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style guide
just doesn't apply. When in doubt, use your best judgement. Look at other
examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!

Some good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:

- When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for
  someone who is used to reading code that follows this style guide.
- To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for
  historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up the
  existing code.
- Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and
  there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
- When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions that
  don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.

We've got a consistent style for:

- [Ruby](programming-languages/ruby.html)
- [Python](programming-languages/python/python.html)
- [Java](programming-languages/java.html)
- [Node.js](programming-languages/nodejs/)

Some of the guidelines in the style guides are codified in a
[.editorconfig](programming-languages/editorconfig) file. Place a copy of this
file in your projectâ€™s repository to have tooling that supports
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) automatically adhere to the
guidelines.
